# Scenario

### Thanks for offering to help, Defender, we appreciate it!  
  
### As we discussed earlier, Initech’s CISO, Milton Waddams, CISSP, CISM, was the victim of a blackmail attempt requesting payment of 50 BTC. We have identified that one of our IT contractors (Brett Hart) was the likely culprit, but we just don’t know how he managed it as he was only a standard user.  
  
### We managed to collect some artifacts from a folder called “Hacking” on his Kali Virtual Machine and we’ve put these into the Investigation folder for you to take a look at.  
  
### We’ve been assured by Milton that the environment is employing all the best practices and is “unhackable”. Please can you investigate and let us know your feedback?

(This Investigation was a practical analyzing the documents that was pulled from the victims machine. Only screenshots and Answer will be posted since no thorough investigation for this challenge wasn't necessary.)
