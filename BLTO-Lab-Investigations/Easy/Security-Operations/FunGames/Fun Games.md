### FunGames is an e-commerce platform for video games owned by FunTech Inc. and has become the target of a criminal who managed to obtain access credentials and exfiltrate some sensitive data. FunTech analysts provide the fugames.pcap file to analyze and retrieve all the pieces of information about the attack.

## Scenario

#### FunGames is an e-commerce platform for video games owned by FunTech Inc. and has become the target of a criminal who managed to obtain access credentials and exfiltrate some sensitive data. FunTech analysts provide the fugames.pcap file to analyze and retrieve all the pieces of information about the attack.

### Investigation Question

**1. What is the IP address of the attacker who is performing the attack?**

- To get the ip address of the victim in wireshark, I filtered for `SYN` and `ACK` flag in Wireshark.
- `tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`
- Below shows continue communication between the source ip and the destination ip during the 3 way hand-shake.

Answer: 192.168.8.130

**2. What is the IP address of the victim?**

- In the same filter, we can see the victims ip address that is responding to the adversary.

Answer: 192.168.8.142

**3. Which attack was performed by the attacker?**

- I filter for `http.request.method == "GET"` to observe what request the adversary was making through the network.
- I stopped at packet 1319 and notice there was a sql user-agent.
- When an adversary performing sql queries for malicious reasons, its an indicator that the adversary is conducting SQL injections.

 Answer: SQLi
 
**4. It seems the attacker used a famous tool to perform the attack.**

- SQLmap is a tool used for penetration purposes that automates process of detecting and exploiting SQL injections

Answer: SQLMAP

**5. In one of the packets, it is possible to view the victim's username and password.**

- I was combing through the OK responses since they were human readable text outputs in html format.
- I notice there was a sql query formate followed by some outputs in the next text/html output.

**6. Once the attacker obtained the victim's credentials he accessed the system via SSH. To gain root privileges, they transferred a file to the victim's machine. What is the name of the file?**

- I was still in the filter of `http && 192.168.8.142` to maintain the pattern of the adversary malicious activities. 
- I notice a text/html exploit file in the "GET" protocol

Answer: Exploit

**7. What is the sha256 hash of the file above?**
- Here I exported the file from Wireshark and save it in the ubuntu directory.

**8. With which CVE is this type of vulnerability identified?**
- I had uploaded the hashvalue to VirusTotal and observing the data. 
- There was a CVE documented on the hashvalue through the community.

Answer: CVE-2024-1086

**9. After obtaining root privileges, it seems that the attacker exfiltrated sensitive data without transferring any files. Provide the string related to this data.**

- This took me a minute to get to.
- after conducting some research on data exfiltration without a file transfer, I was able to discover that data can be trasnferred through dns "tunneling" and ssh protocol. 
- I filtered for dns and notice a "Malformed Packet"
- This indicates that the packet was too large for wireshark to hold show the display of the packet showed as an error.

- I had copy the hex string, since thee question was only asking for the string of the data.

**10. It seems that the string has been encoded. What data did the attacker manage to obtain through exfiltration?**

- I used CyberChef to decode the string. 
- In return, the adversary was able to retrieve a card information for the victim.
